<h2 data-label="636939" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="636939" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Introduction</b></h2><div>The intention of this output is to document and discuss publicly the agreement between transnational corporation Elsevier and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) signed on 1 February 2015.&nbsp;</div><div>The agreement, UNAM-Elsevier contract DGAJ-DPI-39-081114-241, saw the transfer of "production and hosting, advertising and support " of 44 UNAM-published academic open access journals&nbsp;to information and analytics global company Elsevier&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ernesto2017}</cite>. A redacted PDF of a scanned copy of the contract document was leaked anonymously and made available on-line through an anonymous blog post&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{unam}</cite>. We became aware of the contract doing on-line research related to Elsevier on the open Web.</div><div>This output follows the previous publication, in Spanish, of "Revistas académicas de la UNAM entregadas a Elsevier/ScienceDirect"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{elseviersciencedirect}</cite>&nbsp;on<a href="http://humanidadesdigitales.net/blog/2017/08/07/revistas-academicas-elsevier-sciencedirect/" target="_blank"> 8 August 2017</a> on the Humanidades Digitales blog of the Mexican Digital Humanities Network (<a href="http://www.humanidadesdigitales.net/" target="_blank">Red de Humanistas Digitales</a>), and the main body of this output is the result of collaborative adaptation, revision and augmentation of the text that was collectively discussed and co-authored online as an "<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19UFoylwiG-zZhSFh0ol0jETLWiEWSJKLskR-bQ75YFU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">open letter to the international academic community</a>"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{various}</cite> . The collaborative work on the letter, which included English and Spanish versions, took place over a period of three months between august and october 2017 in direct collaboration with colleagues from UNAM who unfortunately, for different reasons, felt unable to sign the letter publicly. That original letter was first signed by&nbsp;28 international academics from 8 different countries including Mexico. The letter is available publicly online and signatures can still be added at  &nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ZL8QF3ZVT4p3KFNr2">https://goo.gl/forms/ZL8QF3ZVT4p3KFNr2</a> &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{form}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>We respect our colleagues' desire for anonymity and understand the pressures they are under. We are also fully aware that the majority of us who sign this output are academics based in institutions in the Global North and therefore not necessarily implicated in or directly affected by the contract in question.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="478146" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Context and Limitations</b></h2><div>We are acutely aware of the geopolitical inequalities in the production and assessment of academic knowledge&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fiormonte,Fiormonte_2017,Graham2011}</cite>. We are therefore particularly sensitive to the fact we are documenting this case from a position of relative academic privilege and geopolitical distance from the actual events. Indeed, rather than contributing to perpetuate the dominance of "North American and Western European perspectives"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bosman2017}</cite>,&nbsp; the genealogy of this text reveals an attempt at contributing to the design of more transparent and open scholarly communication practices that can also “meaningfully be built for and by researchers in the global south"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{april2016}</cite>. In this sense, we openly declare the lack of more Mexico-based names&nbsp;in the byline of this output as a limitation. However, that we are in a position to publish this output can serve the purpose of documenting how commercial interests can potentially tamper with international academic freedom, promoting an atmosphere of disempowerment and fear if critical opinions or discontent are&nbsp;publicly voiced.&nbsp;</div><div>It appears to be common knowledge amongst colleagues associated with UNAM scholarly publishing that the contract in question "is about to end", as it was said to us in personal correspondence. However, it is important to note that there is no public information about when the contract's end date exactly is nor what will happen to the journals under contract after the agreement ends. </div><div>Though we are aware that this output is being published belatedly as the contract is&nbsp;<i>fait accompli,&nbsp;</i>we would still like to document that transparency and sustainability in scholarly publishing are important considerations that should be publicly discussed with an open and international scope. For insiders in Latin American scholarly communications, this contract is not news. However, as members of international scholarly communities and therefore participant stakeholders in the scholarly commons, we wish to document this case in order to foster wider awareness of current practices in scholarly publishing worldwide and foster future debates on good practices in the transition to more widespread, fair Open Access.&nbsp;</div><div>The latest available figures indicate that UNAM has 4,598 registered researchers, with 30% of all articles published by Mexican researchers having UNAM affiliations; in 2016 alone UNAM researchers published 5, 643 articles registered in International Science Indicators&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{universitarias}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2016}</cite>. Since UNAM is a leading educational Latin American institution whose academics and alumni are members of international scholarly communities around the world, and since Elsevier and its parent companies continue to dominate in the global scholarly communications landscape&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mongeon2015}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{r2015}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{j2015}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{m2016}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fiormonte}</cite>, we believe it is important to document and discuss this case in order to establish further knowledge exchange with&nbsp;our colleagues based in Mexico and to leave a precedent in the scholarly record&nbsp;that may hopefully help other institutions facing similar situations.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="721454" class="ltx_title_subsection">The Data</h2><div>The titles of the 44 UNAM Journals under contract with Elsevier appear in the&nbsp;<a href="http://humanidadesdigitales.net/blog/2017/08/07/revistas-academicas-elsevier-sciencedirect/">UNAM-Elsevier contract DGAJ-DPI-39-081114-241</a>. We&nbsp; extracted the data from the PDF and searched for each title manually on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/catalog?producttype=journal">https://www.elsevier.com/catalog?producttype=journal</a> to confirm which journals had a dedicated publicly-available URL on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/a">https://www.journals.elsevier.com/</a>.</div><div> We then created a spreadsheet including the journal consignation number and title according to the contract (columns A and B) and added the corresponding URLs on column C, as shown below (Table 1).&nbsp;</div>

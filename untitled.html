We became aware of the contract doing on-line searches related to Elsevier.</div><div>The main body of this output has been adapted from the text that was collectively discussed and co-authored online as a potential '<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19UFoylwiG-zZhSFh0ol0jETLWiEWSJKLskR-bQ75YFU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">open letter to the international academic community</a>' over a period of three months in direct collaboration with colleagues from UNAM who unfortunately, for different reasons, felt unable to sign publicly. That original letter was signed by&nbsp; 25 international academics from 9 different countries including Mexico.&nbsp;</div><div>We respect our colleagues' desire for anonymity and understand the pressures they are under. We are also fully aware that we&nbsp;who sign this output are mostly academics based in institutions in the Global North and therefore not necessarily implicated in or directly affected by the contract in question.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="478146" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Context</b></h2><div>The titles of the 44 UNAM Journals under contract with Elsevier appear in the&nbsp;<a href="http://humanidadesdigitales.net/blog/2017/08/07/revistas-academicas-elsevier-sciencedirect/">UNAM-Elsevier contract DGAJ-DPI-39-081114-241</a>. We searched for each title manually on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/catalog?producttype=journal">https://www.elsevier.com/catalog?producttype=journal</a> to confirm which journals had a dedicated publicly-available URL on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/a">https://www.journals.elsevier.com/</a>. We then created a spreadsheet includided the journal consignation number and title according to the contract (columns A and B) and added the corresponding URLs on column C, as shown below (Table 1). </div>

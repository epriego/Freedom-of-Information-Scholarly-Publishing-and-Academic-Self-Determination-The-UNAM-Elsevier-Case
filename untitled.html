<h2 data-label="636939" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="636939" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Introduction</b></h2><div>The intention of this output is to document and discuss publicly the agreement between transnational corporation Elsevier and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)&nbsp; signed on 1 February 2015. </div><div>The agreement, UNAM-Elsevier contract DGAJ-DPI-39-081114-241, saw the transfer of &nbsp;"production and hosting, advertising and support "of 44 UNAM-published academic  open access journals&nbsp;to publishing company Elsevier&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ernesto2017}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ernesto2017a}</cite>.&nbsp; A redacted PDF of a scanned copy of the contract document was leaked anonymously and made available on-line through an anonymous  blog post&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{unam}</cite>. We became aware of the contract doing on-line searches related to Elsevier.</div><div>The main body of this output has been adapted from the text that was collectively discussed and co-authored online as a potential '<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19UFoylwiG-zZhSFh0ol0jETLWiEWSJKLskR-bQ75YFU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">open letter to the international academic community</a>' over a period of three months in direct collaboration with colleagues from UNAM who unfortunately, for different reasons, felt unable to sign publicly. That original letter was signed by&nbsp; 25 international academics from 9 different countries including Mexico.&nbsp;</div><div>We respect our colleagues' desire for anonymity and understand the pressures they are under. We are also fully aware that we&nbsp;who sign this output are mostly academics based in institutions in the Global North and therefore not necessarily implicated in or directly affected by the contract in question.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="478146" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Context</b></h2><div> We are acutely aware of the geopolitical inequalities in the production and assessment of academic knowledge&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{corinne2011}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fiormonte,Fiormonte_2017}</cite>. We are therefore particularly sensitive to the fact we are documenting this case from a position of relative academic privilege and geopolitical distance from the actual events. Indeed, rather than contributing to perpetuate the dominance of "North American and Western European perspectives"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bosman2017}</cite>,&nbsp; the genealogy of this text reveals an attempt at contributing to the design of more transparent and open scholarly communication practices that can also â€œmeaningfully be built for and by researchers in the global south"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{april2016}</cite>. &nbsp; In this sense, we openly declare the lack of more Mexico-based names&nbsp; in the byline of this output as a limitation, and regret a state of affairs where col. However, that we are in a position to publish this output can serve the purpose of documenting how commercial interests can potentially tamper with international academic freedom, promoting an atmosphere of disempowerment and fear if critical opinions or discontent are&nbsp;publicly voiced.&nbsp;</div><div>It appears to be common knowledge amongst colleagues associated with UNAM scholarly publishing that the contract in question "is about to end". However, there is no public information about when the end date is exactly nor what will happen after the contract ends. Though we are aware that this output is being published belatedly as the contract is a&nbsp;<i>fait accompli,&nbsp;</i>we would still like to document that transparency and sustainability in scholarly publishing are important considerations that should be publicly discussed with an open and international scope. For insiders in Latin American scholarly communications, this contract is not news. However, as members of international scholarly communities and therefore participant stakeholders in the scholarly commons, we wish to document this case in order to foster wider awareness of current practices in scholarly publishing worldwide and foster future debates on good practices in the transition to open access. </div><div>Since UNAM is a leading educational Latin American institution whose academics and alumni are members of international scholarly communities around the world, and since Elsevier and its parent companies continue to dominate in the global scholarly communications landscape, we believe it is important to document and discuss this case in order to establish fuerther knowledge exchange with&nbsp;our colleagues based in Mexico and to leave a precedent in the scholarly record&nbsp;that may hopefully help other institutions facing similar situations.&nbsp;</div><div>  </div>

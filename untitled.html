<div><b>Introduction</b></div><div>The intention of this output is to document and discuss publicly  the agreement between transnational corporation Elsevier and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)&nbsp; signed on February 1, 2015. The agreement, under the&nbsp;<a href="http://humanidadesdigitales.net/blog/2017/08/07/revistas-academicas-elsevier-sciencedirect/">UNAM</a><a href="http://humanidadesdigitales.net/blog/2017/08/07/revistas-academicas-elsevier-sciencedirect/">-Elsevier contract DGAJ-DPI-39-081114-241</a>, saw the transfer of &nbsp;"Production and accommodation, advertising and support "of 44 academic journals of open access of the UNAM (see the list&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3976752.v1">here</a>) to publishing company Elsevier. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>This document was discussed and co-authored over a period of three months in direct collaboration with colleagues from UNAM who felt unable to sign publicly.&nbsp; We are fully aware that the undersigned are mostly academics based in institutions in the Global North. Given the geopolitical inequalities in the production and assessment of academic knowledge, we are particularly sensitive to the fact we are documenting this case from a position of relative privilege and distance from the actual events.&nbsp;</div><div>However, since UNAM is a leading educational Latin American institution whose academics and alumni are members of international scholarly communities around the world, and since Elsevier and its parent companies continue to dominate in the global scholarly communications landscape, we believe it is important to document and discuss this case in order to establish fuerther knowledge exchange with&nbsp;our colleagues based in Mexico and to leave a precedent in the scholarly literature that may help other institutions facing similar situations. </div><div><b>Background</b></div>

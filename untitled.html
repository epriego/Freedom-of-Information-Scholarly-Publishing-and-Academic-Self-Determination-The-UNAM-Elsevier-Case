<div><b>Introduction</b></div><div>The intention of this output is to document and discuss publicly  the agreement between transnational corporation Elsevier and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)&nbsp; signed on February 1, 2015. The agreement, UNAM-Elsevier contract DGAJ-DPI-39-081114-241, saw the transfer of &nbsp;"Production and accommodation, advertising and support "of 44 academic journals of open access of the UNAM (see the list&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3976752.v1" target="_blank">here</a>) to publishing company Elsevier.&nbsp;  A redacted copy of the contract document was leaked anonymously and made available on-line through an anonymous Wordpress blog. We became aware of the contract doing on-line searches related to Elsevier.</div><div>The main body of this output contains text that was collectively discussed and co-authored online as a potential 'open letter to the international academic community' over a period of three months in direct collaboration with colleagues from UNAM who felt unable to sign publicly. </div><div>We respect our colleagues' desire for anonymity and understand the pressures they are under. We are also fully aware that we&nbsp; who sign this output are mostly academics based in institutions in the Global North and therefore not necessarily implicated in or directly affected by the contract in question.&nbsp;Given the geopolitical inequalities in the production and assessment of academic knowledge, we are particularly sensitive to the fact we are documenting this case from a position of relative privilege and distance from the actual events. We declare this as a limitation of this output, but also as a means to document how commercial interests can potentially tamper with international academic freedom, promoting an atmosphere of disempowerment and fear if critical opinions or discontent are&nbsp;publicly voiced.&nbsp;</div><div>It appears to be common knowledge amongst Colleagues associated with UNAM that wished not to be named have informed us through personal correspondence that the contract in question "is about to end", but there is no public information about when this is exactly nor what will happen after that.&nbsp; We are aware that this output is being published belatedly as the contract is a&nbsp;<i>fait accompli.&nbsp;</i>We would still like to document that transparency and sustainability in scholarly publishing are important considerations that should be publicly discussed.</div><div>Since UNAM is a leading educational Latin American institution whose academics and alumni are members of international scholarly communities around the world, and since Elsevier and its parent companies continue to dominate in the global scholarly communications landscape, we believe it is important to document and discuss this case in order to establish fuerther knowledge exchange with&nbsp;our colleagues based in Mexico and to leave a precedent in the scholarly record&nbsp; that may help other institutions facing similar situations.&nbsp;</div><div><b>Background</b></div>

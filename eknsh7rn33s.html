<div>The undersigned consider that international academic communities deserve to be informed about the costs of academic publishing. In this particular case the community should have been consulted and informed more openly and transparently about the causes, conditions and consequences of this contract, which, in fact , delivers a significant portion of the public and cultural heritage of the university to a for-profit transnational corporation.</div>

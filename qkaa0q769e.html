<div>Given the context we wish to share the following considerations:</div><ul><div></div><li><div>It is important to reconsider the primacy of the right to access public information on contractual terms imposed by transnational for-profit corporations to publicly financed institutions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lawson,Lawson_2014}</cite>.</div></li><li><div>The reasons why a publicly-financed institution&nbsp;considers necessary to request scholarly publishing services from a for-profit third party should have been disclosed widely and transparently. In this case, it is essential to emphasise that Latin America is one of the leading regions in the world in regards to open access scientific journal publishing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{UNESCO2017}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Alperin2015,UNESCO2017}</cite>. Moreover,  Mexico's Open Access Law Initiative&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{pblicos}</cite> had offered public funding for the "creation, adaptation or maintenance of open access publishing platforms"; said initiative became law on 20 May 2014&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{r2014}</cite>. For perspective,&nbsp; as we have documented the Elsevier-UNAM contract included 44 UNAM journals;<a href="http://www.redalyc.org/home.oa" target="_blank"> REDALyC</a> indexes 46 UNAM journals&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mxico}</cite>.&nbsp;</div></li><li><div>It would be good practice for publicly-financed institutions to make  bidding processes details public, disseminating them widely, and including what other alternatives were considered prior to selecting a particular provider. In this case, there was&nbsp;no public information on the rationale for contracting Elsevier's to provide "production, hosting, advertising and support" services for UNAM open access journals.</div></li><li><div>Amounts of contracts between publicly-financed institutions and for-profit publishers should be published openly and publicly. This information becomes useful to take better, informed decisions regarding scholarly communication costs. In this case,&nbsp; both UNAM and Elsevier should have publicly and more widely informed the university community, and the general public, of the economic commitment by the UNAM under the contract in question, both as a total amount as well as disaggregated for each of the journals involved.</div></li><li><div>In general specific contacts of journal managers in charge of journals should be clearly advertised on scholarly journals and platforms. In this case, the journal managers at Elsevier / ScienceDirect responsible for the migration, hosting, and maintenance of each of the ScienceDirect pages designated for the UNAM journals as detailed in the contract are unknown or the information is unclear.</div></li><li><div>Whenever a contract is established between a publicly-financed institution and a third-party provider,  a timeline for the completion of the contracted work should be publicly disclosed. In this case, a timeline for the migration of the production line and hosting of previous contents, including a detailed list of specific tasks of "advertising and support" should have been made public.</div></li><li><div>Research data management (RDM), digital preservation and sustainability strategies and scholarly communication policies implicit in the clauses included in contracts should also be available to the public and key stakeholders. This is particularly important in relation to open access data management policy.&nbsp;</div></li></ul><h2 data-label="818274" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Discussion </b></h2><div>We believe the set of considerations&nbsp;presented above constitute instances of good practice regarding the handling of contracts between publicly-funded institutions and publishers. These considerations are shared in order to promote their discussion, adaptation, and implementation. If good practices regarding transparency and community participation in how institutional publishing contracts are handled&nbsp;are more widely and collaboratively discussed and developed,&nbsp;the national and international academic community would be able to follow in an informed, transparent, and expeditious manner the mechanisms for conducting contracts of public interest whose conditions have an effect on national and international academia, the public, and public intellectual heritage.&nbsp;</div><div>Writing a decade ago about intangible cultural heritage, Kurin had already warned that </div><div></div><blockquote><div>Governments,  or  university  departments  or  museums,  cannot  just  assume  that  they  have permission   to   define   intangible   cultural   heritage   and   undertake   its   documentation, presentation,   protection,   or   preservation.   Community   participation   is   meant   to   be significant  and  meaningful involving  the  consent  of  community  leaders,  consultation&nbsp; with  lead  cultural  practitioners,  shared  decision  making  on  strategies  and  tactics  of safeguarding  and  so  on&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{richard2007}</cite>.</div></blockquote><div></div><div>The academic production of National Universities funded with public funds is an important component of a country's tangible and intangible cultural heritage. Digitisation and use of third-party publishing platforms complicates notions of Intellectual Property ownership and it has practical and legal geopolitical implications&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hennessy2012}</cite>. Kurin's concept in relation to UNESCO's Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{unesco}</cite> finds echoes in Bosman et al's recent discussion of the scholarly commons as essentially bottom-up and participatory. The  considerations we have presented above seek to complement these ongoing attempts to define collectively the principles of the scholarly commons,   	 		 		 	 	 		which "start   from   the vision   that   scholarly   communication   needs   to   be   as   open   and   participatory   as   possible"&nbsp;and that indeed, "a publisher   would   be   considered   any   entity   that makes   scholarly   objects   available   according   to   the   principles   of   the   commons"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bosman2017}</cite> .&nbsp;</div><div>By not encouraging a wider public discussion on why a public national university with a legacy of experience in academic publishing would want to cede the production of 44 of their journals to a for-profit third-party, and by not enabling public access to the information detailing the cost to the university in question, this case enacted principles that stand in contradiction to evolving principles of the scholarly commons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div> Publicly-funded knowledge is, indeed, a common good: researchers and publishers have a responsibility to the public to provide free access&nbsp;to these research products. Additionally, researchers have a responsibility to the public to conduct rigorous research that provides the best value for money, which will, in turn, earn public trust. Therefore, it is crucial that researchers, as key participants and stakeholders in scholarly communications, retain control over how their research is conducted and disseminated. If&nbsp;researchers and their institutions retain such control, they can act in the best interests of academia whose goal is to share knowledge, rather than in the best interests of  publishers whose goal is to maximize profits&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Logan2017}</cite>. </div><div>This control from researchers and their institutions over how they choose to disseminate and preserve their research outputs can be understood as an act of academic self-determination. The processes to gain such control should be open, inclusive, transparent and participatory. Scholarly publishing and academic self-determination are interdependent and a crucial point of future debate for the future of university presses and Open Access worldwide.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="470064" class="ltx_title_subsection">Note</h2><div>Colleagues wishing to add their signature to the original open letter that inspired this article can still do it   at  &nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ZL8QF3ZVT4p3KFNr2">https://goo.gl/forms/ZL8QF3ZVT4p3KFNr2</a> &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{form}</cite>.&nbsp;  &nbsp;</div>

This information becomes useful to take better, informed decisions regarding scholarly communication costs.

In this case, the journal managers at Elsevier / ScienceDirect responsible for the migration, hosting, and maintenance of each of the ScienceDirect pages designated for the UNAM journals as detailed in the contract are unknown or the information is unclear.</div></li><li><div>Whenever a contract is established between a publicly-financed institution and a third-party provider,  a timeline for the completion of the contracted work should be publicly disclosed.

This is particularly important in relation to open access data management policy.&nbsp;</div></li></ul><div>We believe this set of considerations constitutes good practice regarding the handling of contracts between publicly-funded institutions and publishers. If discussed, adapted, and observed, the national and international academic community would be able to follow in an informed, transparent, and expeditious method for conducting contracts of public interest whose conditions have an effect on national and international academia, the public, and public intellectual heritage. Writing a decade ago about intangible cultural heritage, Kurin had already warned that </div><blockquote><div>Governments,  or  university  departments  or  museums,  cannot  just  assume  that  they  have permission   to   define   intangible   cultural   heritage   and   undertake   its   documentation, presentation,   protection,   or   preservation.   Community   participation   is   meant   to   be significant  and  meaningful involving  the  consent  of  community  leaders,  consultation&nbsp; with  lead  cultural  practitioners,  shared  decision  making  on  strategies  and  tactics  of safeguarding  and  so  on </div></blockquote><div>These considerations also seek to complement ongoing attempts to define collectively the principles of the scholarly commons,   	 		 		 	 	 		which&nbsp;  "start   from   the vision   that   scholarly   communication   needs   to   be   as   open   and   participatory   as   possible"&nbsp; and that indeed,&nbsp; "a publisher   would   be   considered   any   entity   that makes   scholarly   objects   available   according   to   the   principles   of   the   commons"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bosman2017}</cite> . &nbsp;By not encouraging a wider public discussion on why a public university with a wealth of experience in academic publishing would want to cede the production of 44 of their journals to a for-profit third-party, and by not enabling public access to the information detailing the cost to the university, this case represents principles that stand in contradiction to evolving principles of the scholarly commons. </div><div> Publicly-funded knowledge is, indeed, a common good: researchers and publishers have a responsibility to the public to provide free access&nbsp;to these research products&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{logan2017we}</cite>.&nbsp; Additionally, researchers have a responsibility to the public to conduct rigorous research that provides the best value for money, which will, in turn, earn public trust. Therefore, it&nbsp; is crucial that researchers, as key participants and stakeholders in scholarly communications, retain control over how their research is conducted and disseminated. If&nbsp;researchers retain such control, they can act in the best interests of academia whose goal is to share knowledge, rather than in the best interests of  publishers whose goal is to maximize profits&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Logan2017}</cite>. This control can be understood as an act of academic self-determination.&nbsp;</div><div>Scholarly publishing and academic self-determination are interdependent and a crucial point of future debate for the future of University presses and Open Access worldwide.&nbsp;</div>

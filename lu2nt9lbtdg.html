<ul><li><div>It is important to reconsider the primacy of the right to access public information on contractual terms imposed by transnational for-profit corporations to publicly financed institutions.</div></li><li><div>The reasons why a publicly-financed institution&nbsp;considers necessary to request scholarly publishing services from a for-profit third party should be discolsed widely and transparently. In this case, it is essential to emphasise that Latin America is one of the leading regions in the world in regards to open access scientific journal publishing &nbsp;<a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/portals-and-platforms/goap/access-by-region/latin-america-and-the-caribbean/">(UNESCO 2017).</a></div></li><li><div>It would be good practice for publicly-financed institutions to make  bidding processes details public, disseminating them widely, and including what other alternatives were considered prior to selecting a particular provider. Int his case, there was&nbsp;no public information on the rationale for contracting Elsevier's to provide "production, hosting, advertising and support" services for UNAM open access journals.</div></li><li><div>Amounts of contracts between publicly-financed instit. Both UNAM and Elsevier must publicly and more widely inform the university community, and the general public, of the economic commitment by the UNAM under the contract in question, both as a total amount as well as disaggregated for each of the journals involved.</div></li><li><div>Publicise the specific contacts of the journal managers at Elsevier / ScienceDirect responsible for the migration, hosting, and maintenance of each of the ScienceDirect pages designated for the UNAM journals as detailed in the contract.</div></li><li><div>Disclose a timeline for the migration of the production line and hosting of previous contents, including a detailed list of specific tasks of "advertising and support".</div></li><li><div>Disclose data management (RDM) and scholarly communication policies implicit in the clauses included in the contract. This is articularly important in relation to open access data management policy. &nbsp;</div></li></ul><div></div>

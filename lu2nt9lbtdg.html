<ul><li><div>It is important to reconsider the primacy of the right to access public information on contractual terms imposed by transnational for-profit corporations to publicly financed institutions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lawson,Lawson_2014}</cite></div></li><li><div>The reasons why a publicly-financed institution&nbsp;considers it necessary to request scholarly publishing services from a for-profit third party should be discolsed widely and transparently. In this case, it is essential to emphasise that Latin America is one of the leading regions in the world in regards to open access scientific journal publishing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{portal2017}</cite>.</div></li><li><div>It would be good practice for publicly-financed institutions to make  bidding process details public, disseminating them widely, and including what other alternatives were considered prior to selecting a particular provider. In this case, there was&nbsp;no public information on the rationale for contracting Elsevier to provide "production, hosting, advertising and support" services for UNAM's open access journals.</div></li><li><div>The costs of the contracts between publicly-financed institutions and for-profit publishers should be published openly and publicly. This information becomes useful to make better and more informed decisions regarding scholarly communication costs. In this case,&nbsp; both UNAM and Elsevier should have publicly and more widely informed the university community, and the general public, of the economic commitment by the UNAM under the contract in question, both in terms of the total amount as well as the cost for each of the journals involved.</div></li><li><div>In general, specific contacts made by managers in charge of journals should be clearly advertised on scholarly journals and platforms. In this case, the individuals at Elsevier / ScienceDirect who are responsible for the migration, hosting, and maintenance of each of the ScienceDirect pages designated for a particular UNAM journal as detailed in the contract are unknown or the information is unclear.</div></li><li><div>Whenever a contract is established between a publicly-financed institution and a third-party provider,  a timeline for the completion of the contracted work should be publicly disclosed. In this case, a timeline for the migration of the production line and hosting of previous contents, including a detailed list of specific tasks of "advertising and support" should have been made public.</div></li><li><div>Research data management (RDM), digital preservation and sustainability strategies and scholarly communication policies implicit in the clauses included in contracts should also be available to the public and key stakeholders. This is particularly important in relation to open access data management policy.&nbsp; </div></li></ul><div></div>

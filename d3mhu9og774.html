On column D we indicated if by January 2016 the content on that URL was live or not , and we checked each URL again on August 2017 and added that data on column E. On column F we noted if the page on each journal's respective Web page contained an article listing or not. We manually visited each journal's URL and followed the links and noted what happened after clicking the link on the 'Elsevier hub' on column G. On a second sheet we included a second sheet including a summary of the contract's key information across ten columns.

Therefore, it&nbsp; is crucial that researchers, as key participants and stakeholders in scholarly communications, retain control over how their research is conducted and disseminated. If&nbsp;researchers retain such control, they can act in the best interests of academia whose goal is to share knowledge, rather than in the best interests of  publishers whose goal is to maximize profits&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Logan2017}</cite>. This control can be understood as an act of academic self-determination.&nbsp;</div><div>Scholarly publishing and academic self-determination are interdependent and a crucial point of future debate for the future of University presses and Open Access worldwide.&nbsp;</div>

Additionally, researchers have a responsibility to the public to conduct rigorous research that provides the best value for money, which will, in turn, earn public trust. Therefore, it is crucial that researchers retain control over how their research is conducted and disseminated. If&nbsp;researchers retain such control, they can act in the best interests of academia whose goal is to share knowledge, rather than in the best interests of  publishers whose goal is to maximize profits <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Logan2017}</cite>.</b></i></div><div>Scholarly publishing and academic self-determination are interdependent and a crucial point of future debate for the future of University presses and Open Access worldwide.&nbsp;</div>
